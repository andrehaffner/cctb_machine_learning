Step 6: Send and Recieve Data From Server
===========================================

Implement the main frontend functionality.

In this step we write most of the javascript to send and receive json data from the server. We download and introduce jQuery, and then use it in the following tasks (in order):

  - Grab the coefficients that the user inputs and wrap in some json.
  - Send the json to the server using the ajax method.

This is probably the most difficult step.  Take it slow!
